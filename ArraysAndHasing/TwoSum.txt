I understood the one pass hashmap approach conceptually, but really struggled to get the correct output - mine would be the values not the indices. The use of enumerate was new to me, but i figured out it just replaces using range(len(arr)) and is rather useful. 
The time and space complexity is O(n), since we use the hashmap and make one pass. Almost akin to the problem i encountered in Scheme in first year, where we were explicitly using FP to recurse big lists and find targets that satisified some predicate.
Definitely could use more practice with enumerate, this is a new keyword to me. However I understood this problem conceptually, it was just the implementation that I strugged with.
Another day, another problem, 3/150 down
