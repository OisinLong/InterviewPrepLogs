I needed to look at the 3 hints given to come up with any solution for this problem. I was initially gonnna have an isAnagram function that compares two strings, then use some kind of two pointer iteration to make passes through the array.
The defaultdict is used to avoid an edge case. It works by initialising an emtpy list when a key is acessed for the first time, saving us the check of seeing if we must append or create each time.
We cannot use arrays as a key in Python, so we must make it immutable via tuple. The use of ord() to get the correct indexing of the chr for the array reminded me of my early days in C, where i was first introduced to this underlying value of each and every chr. By simply making a list of the hashmaps values, we have our answer. The time complexity is O(m*n) as we iterate over the list and every word in the list also. The space complexity is O(m) where m is the length of the list as we create our hashmap to store the values.
There was a lot of fiddling with the format of the output on this question, and it took me a while to understand the logic but I do understand it now. The use of defaultdict and ord was new to me, so I will mkae use of these concepts going forward. The use of a fixed len array for identifying anagrams instead of sorting them was a nice saving in time complexity since we are constrained to lower case alphabet only.
