Getting the hang of it now, after looking at the hints ans thinking about it, the use of a hash set became obvious to me. The important disticntion here is that we do not need to maintain order, simply keep checking in O(1) time if n+1 is in the hash set. This was probably the only prt that confused me, as I initially thought I would have to maintain the order of the array. Time and space complextiy are both O(n), since we only make one pass and only use one set. Quick one today, but I was very tempted not to do this at all - so proud of myselft for slowly building the habit. If I turn this into a blog at some point, I will have a bank of reflections to draw knowledge from and aid me in my study.
