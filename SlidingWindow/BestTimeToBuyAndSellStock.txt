Okay this took a few minutes to understand. initially I was still in complete two pointer mode, and tried to iterate using i and j, but then it clicked that the sliding window did't have to be explicitly iterated with two pointers, the max/min logic took care of that and acted as the non-linear iterable, only changing when a new low or high was discovered. Overall a nice introduction to the topic, if only the real life markets reflected such profit! TSMC down some percent today but after reading Chip War years ago, my faith is well placed I believe. 
Upon review of the poted solutions, I suppose my solution isn't really a sliding window approach, despite me thinking so. My reasoning was that the buy variiable acted as one ptr for my sliding window, even tho it was storing the value as opposed to index. I suppose this is the semantics that confuses me sometimes. It's an interesting argument - I may poke some LLMs and see what comes out. Nonetheless, my solution was optimal at least in the eyes of big O. Not so sure about actual reality but again, implementation can vary between languages so I won't get too hung up on it.
