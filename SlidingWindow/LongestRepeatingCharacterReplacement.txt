No luck so far, might be because I am not able to focus as clearly. I'm going to watch the video and try understand it. Okay I wa actually kind of close with my original attempt, I just hadn't got the fiddly predicates for recognising when to allow some replaceable chrs in the string. The lgic makes sense, and links back to the fist topic of hashing and arrays. 
I was thinking I could get away with using a set, but the distinction here vs the last set is that we are looking for a string with the same chr, so set is not of much use to us. Overall a semi challenging problem, that reduces to a nice O(n) time and O(m) space, where O(m) is the number of unique chrs in the string.
