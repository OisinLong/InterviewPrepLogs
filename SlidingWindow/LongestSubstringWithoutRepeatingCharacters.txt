My initial idea is to use a hash set to store chrs seen so far, and move two pointers along from the start, and use the set to keep track of what has been seen so far in the window. My implementation struggles and only passes 9 test cases, not sure exactly where I am going wrong. Wil look at the hints and/or video and attempt again.
After looking at the hints and the drawing part of the video, I understand the algorithm but cannot implement it in code, I am really struggling.
Okay, that is actually rather simple, clearly I need to revise the concept of sliding window more. Doing this problem a day in advance to give myself the day to focus on coursework tmrw, but I still intend on having one done for every day - but being flexible and allowing myself to accrue a  buffer of problems for busy times. The time complexity of this is O(n), and space is O(m) where m is the length of the substring. I was studying asymptotic analysis today, so I feel like I understand this notation even further now!
