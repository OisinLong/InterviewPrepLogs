This one was kinda fiddly, but after doing the previous problems a few times the pattern is becoming very clear to me. The only friction in these questions is finding some of the predicates or fiddly formulas for indexing or something like that. Again, it is nice to see my knowledge progress as I delve further and further into each topic. So far so good!
It has definitely been hard and challenging, but I am definitely improving with each day.
This algorithm works by taking advantage of the fact that each string is bound to lowercase english letters, thus having constant space of 26 for frequency arrays. We initialise two frequency arrays, and fill them both with the contents of a window of span s1. For my approach, all prior comparisions use direct array comparisions instead of the given approach that uses a matches variable, but O(26) vs O(1) is a sacrifice I am willing to make in the name of clarity. We then initialize r over s2 minus s1 (this is the sliding window) We only use one pointer technically, but use it to both add the right chr to the array and remove the left chr, maintaining a fixed size sliding window.
This solution is O(n) time and O(1) space, despite being slightly less efficient than the matched variable approach. Heuristics could be used as an excuse here, but I would hope that this solution is enough for interviews.
