Initially I am thinking that I can use some kind of hashmpa to store each element and build a frequency table of sorts. I believe the question is only asking for one distinct element each time, so I will never have to return multiple of the same element? Not sure tho, will need to see some more test cases. I will code up this hashmap frequency table and use the element as the key, and the count as the value I think. This was not the solution, needed to watch the video to figure out bucket sort was needed. Kind of the same principle as what i was going for but i struggled with implementation.
Post problem analysis.
I did have the right idea with the hashmap and counting frequencies, however the use of bucket sort on top of the hashmap was new to me, and I did not think of implementing that myself. The logic is fairly simple once coded, there was no new keywords or methods used, just the bucketsort algorithm which I hadnt come across before. Actuallly, the use of an inline for loop to initialise the empty array was new, but easy to understand.
The fact these problems are organised by heading does give some hints in and of itself once you have done a few, as you can pretty much gauge the underlying data strucutres being used. However I am definitely still challeneged, and will be revisiting the problems to really reinforce the algorithms and solutions which will better equip me for interviews.
