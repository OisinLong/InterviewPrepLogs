My initial thoughts for this are to set a max area to zero, then just close in the container and compare the resulting area. But I realise this will not compare every possible container, so I am unsure right now as to how to make sure that i correctly identify the largest container. Maybe some kind of predicate to control the pointers moving in?
Alright, after looking at the third hint I solved this. I wasn't able to come up with the predicate myself, but I would hope in an interview setting that my base knowledge would suffice and some hints may lead me the right way. It is nice to see myself recognise patterns as this goes on, hopefully it all pays off someday. I definitely blew my chances for this semester, but I hope that this can fuel me to stay consistent and disciplined this year to show my full potential. Anyways, not the worst problem, just figuring out the predicate I needed for iteration was kinda difficult.
The solution is O(n) for time, as we only iterate thru the array once, and O(1) space is needed since we use constant memory.
