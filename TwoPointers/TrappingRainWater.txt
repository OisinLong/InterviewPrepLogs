So I'm gonna have to find some kind of formula or classifier to decide the volume of each gap betweeen bars. Some kind of DFS seems like an obvious choice, DFS in the sense that I fully explore the first gap's volume before moving on to the next one. Maybe if I started both pointers from the left, and moved one until we found a volume, then set the left to right and moved on. This would be O(n) time and O(1) space, so pretty optimal. Not completely sure of how to come up with a predicate to identify when we have calculated the volume of a gap. If the next bar is >= the previous bar, this would signifythe end of the volume for that gap. Then to get the volume between we could figure it out.
Okay after looking at the first hint it suggests calculating how much water is held at each position in the array, as well as suggesting that O(n) space is sufficient here. Perhaps we calculate the volumes for each index this way, then use the array as a reference for the calculations when traversing as I suggested earlier from left to right.
