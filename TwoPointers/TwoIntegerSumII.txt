After looking at the reccomended time and space complextiy, it became more obvious that a solution using two pointers was going to be necessary. Given the target, but also knowing that the array is sorted allowed me to know the properties of what altering a pointer would do. Going from the left, the values increase, therefore if the sum is too small simply move left. Conversely, going form the right the values decrease, so it was rather obvious what to do. I'm sure there is some cleaner ways to return  list than just wrapping the values in round brackets, but it works so hey - abstraction and such....
I suppose that the one indexing is there to try and catch people out, but I didn't really struggle with anything for this problem. Algorithmic Problem Solving by Roland Backhouse comes to mind, a book from a module I took in first year of college. The professor was one of my favorites, with a tangible passion for his lectures and I remeber being introduced to the concept of parity among other things, and how states can change as we move through a problem. The abstraction I learned from that module definitely helped me - and especially for this problem where it could be easy to get hung up on fiddly details about the target. Sticking to the key problem and abstracting is a key skill that we need as Computer Scientists, which I appreciate even more as I delve into ever more complicated topics. Pontificating aside, it was a relatively easy problem to solve and I hope I can endeavor with this ease for the rest of my DSA journey!
Footnote haha lol I will come back to cry at the optimism on display here.
