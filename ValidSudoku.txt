I am completely stumped here, even after looking at the hints, I am not sure how a set is of use here, as the "." chrs mean that the lenght will be different regardless so it is pointless to check, unless we start with empty sets and only append the numbers then use it for memberhsip checks, but at that point can I not just use an array?
Okay, I looked ay all the hints, but my soltion made seperate passes for each category. The better solutino would be to have an array of sets for each conditino, then just add to them all respectively in one pass, reducing th work 3 fold. Overall this was a very confusing problem, with a lot of potential optimising to consider. One more to go in this topic, will definitely have to revise further to drive all these concepts home.
